# creating_WordCloud


This repo contains a pyhton script which helps you create your own Word Cloud.



To create your own WordCloud, replace the contents of the 'wordcloud.txt' folder with your own text.

## IMPORTANT:

Keep the 'wordcloud.txt' file and 'word_cloud.py' file both in the same directory.
Before running the script make sure you install the wordcloud module.
